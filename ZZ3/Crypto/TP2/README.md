# Vigenere Cryptanalysis

**Vigenere Cryptanalysis** is a program made to decrypt Vigenere cipher texts by analyzing the possible keys used for.

## What It Does

- Decrypts Vigenere cipher texts using a provided key.
- Automatically detects the key size.
- Calculates the Index of Coincidence (IC) to find the key length.
- Analyzes decrypted texts with some possible keys.
- Supports different languages for IC calculations (EN / FR / GER{be} / SPA).

## Usage

1. Provide the encrypted text and the language code.
2. The program attempts to find the possible keys and decrypt the text with the them, with the different languages.
3. Display the decrypted result and potential keys.
